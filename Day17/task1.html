            <p>Even students who are just learning to write, such as kindergartners, can benefit from understanding the structure of a paragraph. As they progress into the later years of elementary school and middle school, they can begin to create paragraphs that include all of the necessary elements. Once a student reaches high school, they should be able to write a paragraph that has a distinct thesis and also includes supporting arguments. 

                Below we explore paragraph structure and elements, list out 20 paragraph writing prompts, and offer you some closing works and links to resources.</p>
