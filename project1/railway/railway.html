<center><h1>ABOUT</h1></center>
<p>Train service in Coimbatore started in 1861, upon the construction of the Podanur–Madras line connecting Kerala and the west coast with the rest of India.[1] Coimbatore lies on the Coimbatore–Shoranur 5 ft 6 in (1,676 mm) broad gauge. Until 1956, the Coimbatore railway division was functioning with Podanur as the Headquarters. In 1956, the headquarters was shifted to Olavakkode, of Kerala state and was named Olavakkode railway division. In 1980, Olavakkode division was renamed Palakkad railway division. It comprised Kerala and western districts of Tamil Nadu. A new Salem railway division was carved out of the Palakkad railway division in 2006 with Salem as its headquarters. The city falls under the Salem Division of the Southern Railway zone of Indian Railways. Coimbatore is one among the top hundred booking stations of Indian Railways.<sup>[2][3][4]</sup> Other major railway stations catering to the city include Coimbatore North Junction, Podanur Junction and minor stations at Pilamedu, Singanallur, Irugur Junction, Periyanaickenpalayam, Thudiyalur, Madukkarai, Somanur and Sulur.<sup>[5][6][7]</sup>
