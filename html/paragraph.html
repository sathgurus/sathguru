<p>The economy of Kangeyam is mostly based in rice hulling, the manufacture of coconut copra (dried kernel used in coconut oil production), ghee production and groundnut cultivation. The region, despite being semi-arid and rain-fed, produces rice throughout the year.[8] Rice procured from the Thanjavur and Cauvery Delta regions in Tamil Nadu and from other states like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are also brought to Kangeyam for processing. There are more than 500 rice mills in the taluk.[10]
